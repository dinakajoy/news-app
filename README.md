# news-app
A news app where you can read up latest news on different topics such as technology, health, science, etc    
It is a Progressive Web Application, so users can install it on their devices

## Description
This is a simple javascript application where users can access different news for the day.
It consumes theguardian.com's API.
Most organizations needs input from other organization on their website and an easy way to achieve this is via their api. This inspired me to build this application. I took the news feed from theGuardian and make up my news content rather than sourcing for news.

## Installation
Clone the repository and cd into the project directory  
Open with live server or open index.html file in your browser    
Register on newsapi.org to get your api key and change the existing one in main.js file   

## Usage
Select source from the drop down to get updated news content based on selected source. 
To get news details, click on the news to get redirected to main news details page. 
This is an installable app (PWA).
